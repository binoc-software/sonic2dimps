# Sonic 2 Dimps Edition
The OFFICIAL repository for the Sonic 2 Hack known as Sonic 2 Dimps Edition

Sonic 2 Dimps Edition (Episode 1) is a hack on Sonic 2 to give it a Dimps-alike treatment because SEGA knows what the fans want ;)

S2DIMPS was originally created by a Sonic Scene member known as SOTI but since has abandoned the project and allowed Binary Outcast to take up the burden of development. This hack has, however, been on the back burner until Sega worked with Valve to allow Sonic hacks to be put up on steam.

With this new potental the project has been revived and will be given the time and resources it deserves.

There is speculation that SOTI (now known as Spanner) may be attempting to reinstate his already abandoned ownership of the project. This is not an acceptable outcome as it was agreed and since documented that the project now belongs to BinOC.

We do acknowledge the effort and prior foundation work done by SOTI, and thank him, but we will not reliquish control or ownership of the project to him or anyone else as he has previously agreed to and has given up any claim to this project when he gave us the source code.

Accept no substitutes! This IS a Binary Outcast Project and has been since 2011.
